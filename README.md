## The Game

Players enter the universe with nothing but a ship and dreams of becoming rich. By seeking out rare minerals from asteroids and other stellar objects, you can mine them. By processing what you mine, you can make _stacks_, which you can then sell at a nearby star port. With your newfound riches, you can then explore further into space, discovering and harvesting new resources.
